# Dispersal-Model
### Created by J.J.Franks for Moss Landing Marine Labs Master's thesis project

### Background:
This project is one branch of a larger MLML thesis titled "IMPACTS OF PHYSICAL EXTREMES ON THE REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT AND DISPERSAL OF STEPHANOCYSTIS OSMUNDACEA" (Franks 2025). 
The goal of this project is to to model dispersal distance potential of S. osmundacea propagules using recorded biological data such as zygote sinking speed, base size, height of conceptacle release along the fronds, in tandem with a computational model parameterizing several physical factors including currents, wave height and period, diffusivity, and shear stress.

#### Models Folder

- Model-GRADY:
  This model is representative of my shallow survey site at Stillwater Cove, Carmel Bay, CA. It uses ADCP and ADV data collected there in 2022 for Logan Grady's MLML Thesis (2024).
- Model-PISCO:
  This model is representative of my deep survey site at Stillwater Cove, Carmel Bay, CA. It uses ADCP data collected there from PISCO in 2015.
